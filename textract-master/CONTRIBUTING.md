Any and all contributions are welcome and appreciated. To make it easy
to keep things organized, this project uses the
[general guidelines](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
for the fork-branch-pull request model for github. Briefly, this means:

1. Make sure your fork's `master` branch is up to date:

    	git remote add deanmalmgren https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract.git
        git checkout master
        git pull deanmalmgren/master

2. Start a feature branch with a descriptive name about what you're
   trying to accomplish:

        git checkout -b csv-support

3. Make commits to this feature branch (`csv-support`, in this case)
   in a way that other people can understand with good commit messages
   to explain the changes you've made:

        emacs textract/parsers/csv_parser.py
	    git add textract/parsers/csv_parser.py
	    git commit -m 'added csv_parser'

4. If an issue already exists for the code you're contributing, use
   [issue2pr](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/) to attach your code to
   that issue:

        git push origin csv-support
		chrome http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com
		# enter the issue URL, HEAD=yourusername:csv-support, Base=master

   If the issue doesn't already exist, just send a pull
   request in the usual way:

        git push origin csv-support
		chrome http://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract/compare


Common contributions: support for new file type
-----------------------------------------------

This project has really taken off, much more so than I would have
thought (thanks everybody!). To help new contributors, I thought I'd
jot down some notes for one of the more common contributions---how to
add support for hitherto unsupported file type `.abc123`:

* write a `Parser` class in `textract/parsers/abc123_parser.py` that
  inherits from `textract.parsers.utils.BaseParser` or
  `textract.parsers.utils.ShellParser` and implements the
  `extract(self, filename, **kwargs)` method.

* add a test file in `tests/abc123/raw_text.abc123`, run textract on
  it like this:

  ```shell
  textract tests/abc123/raw_text.abc123 > tests/abc123/raw_text.txt
  ```

  and add the basic test suite by creating
  a file called `tests/test_abc123.py` with content that looks
  something like this:

  ```python
  # tests/test_abc123.py
  import unittest

  import base


  class Abc123TestCase(unittest.TestCase, base.BaseParserTestCase):
      extension = 'abc123'
  ```

  now you should be able to run tests on your parser with `nosetests
  tests/test_abc123.py` or the tests for every parser with `nosetests`.

* if your package relies on any external sources, be sure to add them
  in either `requirements/python` (for python packages) or
  `requirements/debian` (for debian packages) and update the
  installation documentation accordingly in `docs/installation.rst`.

* add documentation about the awesome new file format this is being
  supported in `docs/index.rst` and be sure to give yourself a pat on
  the back by updating the changelog in `docs/changelog.rst`

* finally, make sure the entire test suite passes by running
  `./tests/run.py` and fix any lingering problems (usually PEP-8
  nonsense).


Style guidelines
----------------

As a general rule of thumb, the goal of this package is to be as
readable as possible to make it easy for novices and experts alike to
contribute to the source code in meaningful ways. Pull requests that
favor cleverness or optimization over readability are less likely to be
incorporated.

To make this notion of "readability" more concrete, here are a few
stylistic guidelines that are inspired by other projects and we
generally recommend:

-  write functions and methods that can `fit on a screen or two of a
   standard
   terminal <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle>`_
   --- no more than approximately 40 lines.

-  unless it makes code less readable, adhere to `PEP
   8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style
   recommendations --- use an appropriate amount of whitespace.

-  `code comments should be about *what* is being done, not *how* it is
   being done <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle>`_
   --- that should be self-evident from the code itself.
